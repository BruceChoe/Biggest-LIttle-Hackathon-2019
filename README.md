# CS302 Bonus Assignment - Hashing
# Authors: Bruce Choe, Daniel Enriquez, Erik Marsh

This project uses block chain implementation in order to hash and get secure data addresses and ensure no manipulation within any data. 
Therefore we have the following specifications:
1. Check if something within the Chain has been manipulated 
2. Add each of the specific nodes to a hashmap with the corresponding hash signature and the data 
3. Use public/private key matching to manipulate/access the chain
