# CS302 Bonus Assignment - Hashing
# Authors: Bruce Choe, Daniel Enriquez, Erik Marsh

This project implements a simple blockchain within C++ for the purpose of CS302 Bonus Project submission.  
The design was approved by Dr.Kostas Alexis, and follows these specifications:
1. Add every block to a hashmap, and use the hashmap to print out every blocks hash signature and data. 
2. Demonstrate proof of work on a block by generating a unique hash for every block. 
3. Use public private key matching to access and manipulate the blockchain.
4. Verify the integrity of the blockchain by checking if the chain has been manipulated 
5. Templates
The program's output and further documentation can be found in "log.pdf" 
Refer to blocks.txt for the file output of the blockchain.
