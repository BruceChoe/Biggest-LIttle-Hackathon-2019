Code for the Biggest Little Hackathon project hosted by Reno's ACM on 11/9/19.
Code project specifications: https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30064433

# Goal: Leverage the due diligence reviews done on third parties that have been completed by other FIs. Design a blockchain-based solution that would allow FIs to publish their third-party due diligence on a distributed ledger to be leveraged and added to by other FIs.

DATA ELEMENTS:
Originating entity ID: to identify the FI that conducted the due diligence
Third-party entity ID: to identify the third party that the due diligence has been conducted upon
Due diligence documentation
Date due diligence was completed
Receiving entity ID: name of FI receiving the due diligence
Additional fields are likely appropriate and can be included at the discretion of the project team.

CLIENT'S EXPECTATIONS
The solution provides efficient and scalable search capability, so FIs can quickly find the relevant third party due diligence published to the blockchain.
In addition to the required data elements, additional data fields are innovatively captured and reported in the blockchain solution to maximize the value.
The solution creates a repository to capture all third party tokens so that interested parties have the ability to access, view, and create new contracts.
